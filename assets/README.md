# Michael Rogers, Homework #01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Task in short
Refactor old code to meet clients of accessibility

## Changes

## Updated HTML Semantics
Changed <div class="header"> to <header class="header">
Changed <div class="footer"> to <Footer class="footer">

## Updated structure of HTML elements
When all styling is removed elements follow a logical sequence, appearance due to sizing of pictures is sub-optimal. However all elemements folow naturally on page.

## Improved Accesiblity on Images
Added alt tags to all images to use alternate search terms relevant to image

## Updated headings
Re-ordered headings so they follow logically h1,h2,h3,h4.

## Renamed Title
Changed from >Title< to >Web Media Management< to quickly and concisely describe the purpose and scope of the business website.

## Updated links
Link for 'Search Engine Operation' was dead. Change link path to point to relevant ID in the HTML.

## Consolidated CSS
Removed individualized classes that all shared the same styling effects, such as <div class="search-engine-optimization">. Replaced them under one consolidated tag <div class="link-point"> as these would be the elements those links would point to.

## Commented on CSS file
added comment descriptions and function of each piece of code in the .css file.

## Checked live version against asignment mock-up.
Live version and assignment mock-up are un-remarkable from one another.
